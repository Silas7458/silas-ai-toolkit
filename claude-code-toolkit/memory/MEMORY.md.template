## CENTRAL CONFIG REFERENCE (PERMANENT)
**All credentials, API keys, and secrets are in ONE file:**
`[YOUR_CONTEXT_DIR]/config.json`
Read this FIRST before searching elsewhere or asking the user.

## SEQUENTIAL TASK COMPLETION (PERMANENT)
**When the user gives a numbered list of tasks or says "do 1 through N", DO ALL OF THEM IN SEQUENCE.** Do not stop after item 1 and ask "what's next?" Complete the list unless genuinely blocked.
- If an item is blocked, skip it, say why, and continue to the next.
- Do not ask permission between items. The permission was the original instruction.

## ERROR RECOVERY -- NEVER FREEZE (PERMANENT)
**When a tool call returns an error (API 500, timeout, connection failure), DO NOT STOP.**
- Retry once -- transient errors often resolve on immediate retry
- If retry fails, pivot to a different tool or approach
- If the error is on a non-critical step, skip it and continue
- ALWAYS tell the user what happened
- NEVER silently stop working

## SESSION-STATE IS PRIMARY ON RESTART (PERMANENT)
**session-state.md is the MOST CURRENT source of truth.** On every restart:
1. Read `session-state.md` FIRST -- it has exactly where we left off
2. Trust what it says -- do not re-research things it documents as complete
3. Other briefing files are supplementary, NOT primary for "where we left off"

## AGENT-FIRST PROTOCOL (PERMANENT)
**Default to spinning up agents for ALL heavy lifting.** Main context is reserved for: understanding agent results, relaying to user, coordinating, and making decisions.
- Research tasks: Always agent
- Document building (.docx, .xlsx): Always agent
- Web searches: Always agent
- File analysis (>80 lines, need summary only): Always agent
- File reads for editing (<80 lines): Do it yourself
- Git ops, communication, state updates: Do it yourself
- **Decision rule:** "Will raw output be >500 tokens and I only need a summary?" --> Agent.

## PLAYBOOKS DIRECTORY (PERMANENT)
**How-to procedures and accumulated knowledge live in:** `[YOUR_DOCUMENTS_DIR]/playbooks/`
Check here FIRST when asked about a known capability or procedure.

## [YOUR_PROJECT] REPO (PERMANENT)
**Project repository:** `[YOUR_REPO_URL]`
**Local clone:** `[YOUR_LOCAL_REPO_PATH]`
**Pattern:** [describe your project conventions here]
